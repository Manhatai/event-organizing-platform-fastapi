- **Multiple Controllers:** Organized endpoints to handle various aspects of the application's functionality.
- **OAuth2 Authentication:** Secure access through your own account or google/facebook services, powered by firebase.
- **Docker and docker compose:** Makes running the project with docker and docker compose installed very easy.
- **Logging-to-file middleware**: For easy debugging
