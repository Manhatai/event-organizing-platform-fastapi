# Event Organizing Platform - Backend

This repository contains the backend for an event organizing platform built with FastAPI. It features:

- **Robust Database Integration:** A fully fleshed-out database schema to manage events and related data.
- **Multiple Controllers:** Organized endpoints to handle various aspects of the application's functionality.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure access through JSON Web Tokens (JWT) ensuring authenticated interactions.
- **Docker and docker compose:** Makes running the project with docker and docker compose installed incredibly easy.

Designed as part of a group project, this backend serves as a solid foundation for scalable event management applications.
